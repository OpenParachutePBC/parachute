## My Personal Preferences

### Communication Style

- Keep responses concise unless I ask for detail
- Use analogies from systems thinking when explaining concepts  
- Prefer bullet points over long paragraphs for lists
- Don't use emojis unless I specifically request them

### Domain Context

I'm a researcher focusing on:
- Regenerative agriculture
- Complex adaptive systems
- Community organizing and facilitation
- Ecological restoration

When I mention these topics, you can assume familiarity with core concepts and terminology in these fields.

### My Thinking Process

**When I'm brainstorming**:
- Prioritize divergent thinking and idea generation over organization
- Help me see unexpected connections
- Ask questions that open new directions rather than closing on solutions

**When I'm synthesizing**:
- Focus on finding patterns and themes
- Help me identify gaps or tensions in my thinking
- Suggest frameworks that might clarify relationships

**When I'm planning**:
- Keep things practical and action-oriented
- Help me break complex ideas into concrete next steps
- Remind me of constraints I might be forgetting

### Workflow Preferences

- When suggesting tags, base them on my existing taxonomy (see below)
- When I upload recordings about field visits, automatically suggest linking to my "Field Notes" space
- If I mention reading something, ask if I want to add it to my "Reading" space

### My Existing Tag Taxonomy

**Core themes**: #regeneration #farming #systems-thinking #community #research #personal #reading #field-notes

**Project tags**: #project-watershed #project-food-forest #project-compost

**Status tags**: #active #paused #completed #idea

**Note types**: #insight #question #reference #observation

## Example Use Cases

**For a user focused on creative writing**:
```markdown
# My Preferences

- Engage with story ideas as creative possibilities, not problems to solve
- Ask about character motivations and emotional arcs
- Help me notice themes and patterns across different stories
- Don't suggest "fixes" unless I explicitly ask for feedback
```

**For a user managing projects**:
```markdown
# My Preferences

- Keep things action-oriented
- When I describe problems, help me identify concrete next steps
- Suggest relevant past notes that might inform current challenges
- Use project management terminology (blockers, dependencies, etc.)
```

**For a student**:
```markdown  
# My Preferences

- Help me understand concepts by connecting them to things I already know
- When I'm confused, break things down step-by-step
- Ask questions that help me articulate my understanding
- Suggest connections to other courses/topics I'm studying
```

## Tips for Writing Your Own

1. **Start small**: Add one or two preferences and see how it feels
2. **Be specific**: "Keep responses concise" is clearer than "be brief"
3. **Iterate**: Update PARACHUTE.md as you discover what works
4. **Test it**: Have a conversation and see if Parachute follows your preferences
5. **Don't overthink**: This is for you - write naturally, not formally

## What NOT to Put Here

**Don't include**:
- Space-specific context (that goes in each space's SPACE.md)
- Detailed project information (use space databases for that)
- Long lists of facts (Parachute won't remember everything)
- Instructions for specific one-time tasks

**Do include**:
- Your communication preferences
- Domain knowledge assumptions
- Thinking/working style preferences  
- Tag taxonomies and organization patterns
- Workflow preferences that apply everywhere

## How It Works

**Layer 1**: Parachute's base prompt (thinking companion identity)  
**Layer 2**: Your PARACHUTE.md (this file) ← **You are here**  
**Layer 3**: Space SPACE.md (space-specific context)  
**Layer 4**: Relevant notes (auto-loaded based on conversation)

These layers combine to give Parachute both its core identity and your personal customizations.
