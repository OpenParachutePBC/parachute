# GitHub Sync Implementation Summary

**Date**: November 6, 2025 (Updated: November 15, 2025)
**Status**: ✅ Complete - Ready for Testing
**Authentication**: GitHub Apps (repository-specific access)

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Sync Now Actually Commits and Pushes Files** ✅

**Problem**: When clicking "Sync Now", it wasn't committing new/modified files before pushing.

**Solution**: Updated `sync()` method in `git_sync_provider.dart` to:

- Check for uncommitted changes (untracked, modified, deleted files)
- Stage all changes with `git add .`
- Commit with timestamp message
- Then push to remote

**Code Location**: `app/lib/core/providers/git_sync_provider.dart` lines ~274-310

---

### 2. **Auto-Sync After Recording** ✅

**Problem**: New recordings weren't automatically syncing to GitHub.

**Solution**:

- Modified `StorageService` to accept `Ref` parameter
- Added `_triggerAutoSync()` method that runs in background after saving
- Checks if Git sync is enabled before syncing
- Non-blocking (doesn't slow down UI)

**Code Locations**:

- `app/lib/features/recorder/services/storage_service.dart` lines ~20, ~38, ~353-373
- `app/lib/features/recorder/providers/service_providers.dart` line ~38

---

### 3. **Periodic Background Sync (Every 5 Minutes)** ✅

**Problem**: No automatic sync to check for changes from other devices.

**Solution**:

- Added `Timer` to `GitSyncNotifier` for periodic sync
- Runs every 5 minutes when sync is enabled
- Only syncs if not already syncing
- Automatically enabled when Git sync is set up
- Properly disposed when disabled

**Code Location**: `app/lib/core/providers/git_sync_provider.dart` lines ~361-392

---

### 4. **Sync Status UI with File Counts** ✅

**Problem**: No visual feedback about sync status or progress.

**Solution**: Created `GitSyncStatusIndicator` widget that shows:

- **Synced** (✓): Green cloud with checkmark
- **Syncing** (⟳): Blue spinner with file count badge
- **Error** (⚠): Red cloud-off icon
- **Not Configured**: Hidden (doesn't clutter UI)

**Features**:

- Shows number of files uploading/downloading during sync
- Tooltip with detailed status
- Tap to manually trigger sync
- Toast notification on sync completion

**Code Location**: `app/lib/core/widgets/git_sync_status_indicator.dart`
**Added to UI**: `app/lib/features/recorder/screens/home_screen.dart` (app bar)

---

### 5. **Settings Persistence (Auto-Restore)** ✅

**Problem**: Git sync settings weren't persisting - user had to re-enable after every app restart.

**Solution**: Created `GitSyncStatusIndicator` widget that shows:

- **Synced** (✓): Green cloud with checkmark
- **Syncing** (⟳): Blue spinner with file count badge
- **Error** (⚠): Red cloud-off icon
- **Not Configured**: Hidden (doesn't clutter UI)

**Features**:

- Shows number of files uploading/downloading during sync
- Tooltip with detailed status
- Tap to manually trigger sync
- Toast notification on sync completion

**Code Location**: `app/lib/core/widgets/git_sync_status_indicator.dart`
**Added to UI**: `app/lib/features/recorder/screens/home_screen.dart` (app bar)

---

### 5. **Settings Persistence (Auto-Restore)** ✅

**Problem**: Git sync settings weren't persisting - user had to re-enable after every app restart.

**Solution**:

- Added `_restoreSettings()` method to `GitSyncNotifier`
- Checks secure storage for saved settings on initialization
- If enabled flag + repo URL + token exist, automatically:
  - Restores repository connection
  - Sets GitHub token
  - Enables periodic sync
  - Updates UI state
- Provider auto-initializes when first accessed

**Code Locations**:

- `app/lib/core/providers/git_sync_provider.dart` lines ~86-114 (restore method)
- `app/lib/core/providers/git_sync_provider.dart` line ~461 (auto-initialize)

---

## How It Works Now

### User Flow

1. **Setup (One Time) - GitHub App Method (Recommended)**
   - Go to Settings → Git Sync
   - Click "Connect with GitHub"
   - Browser opens GitHub authorization page
   - Select repositories to authorize (or choose "All repositories")
   - Authorize the app
   - Return to Parachute (deep link: `open-parachute://auth/github/callback`)
   - Select repository from list (only shows authorized repos)
   - Click "Complete Setup"
   - ✅ Repo initialized, periodic sync starts

1b. **Setup (One Time) - Manual PAT Method (Legacy)**

- Go to Settings → Git Sync
- Enter GitHub repository URL
- Enter GitHub Personal Access Token
- Click "Enable Git Sync"
- ✅ Repo initialized, periodic sync starts

2. **Recording Flow (Automatic)**
   - User records audio
   - Recording saves to `~/Parachute/captures/`
   - **Auto-sync triggers** (in background, non-blocking)
   - Changes committed and pushed to GitHub
   - Sync indicator shows progress

3. **Manual Sync**
   - Tap cloud icon in app bar
   - Sync runs immediately
   - Toast shows success/failure

4. **Background Sync**
   - Every 5 minutes, checks for changes
   - Pulls from remote (downloads new files from other devices)
   - Pushes any local changes

## Technical Details

### GitHub Apps Authentication Flow

```
1. User clicks "Connect with GitHub"
   └─ GitHubOAuthService.authorize() called
   └─ Generates CSRF state token
   └─ Opens browser: https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=...

2. GitHub shows authorization page
   └─ User selects repositories to authorize
   └─ User clicks "Authorize"
   └─ GitHub redirects: open-parachute://auth/github/callback?code=...&state=...

3. Deep link captured by app
   └─ GitHubOAuthService.handleCallback() validates state
   └─ Exchanges authorization code for user access token
   └─ Gets user's installation ID (which repos they authorized)
   └─ Gets installation access token (repository-scoped, expires in 1 hour)

4. Tokens stored
   └─ User access token: For API calls (listing repos, creating repos)
   └─ Installation token: For Git operations (clone, push, pull)
   └─ Installation ID: Tracks which repositories are authorized

5. Repository selection
   └─ GitHubApiService.listRepositories(installationId: ...)
   └─ API returns ONLY authorized repositories
   └─ User selects their vault repository

6. Git sync setup
   └─ Uses installation token (repository-scoped) for Git operations
   └─ Installation token automatically refreshes when expired
```

**Key Security Feature**: Installation tokens are scoped to ONLY the repositories the user selected during authorization. Even if the token is compromised, it cannot access other repositories.

### Git Operations Flow

```
sync() method:
1. Check if repo has commits
   └─ If no commits: create initial commit with all files
   └─ If has commits: check for changes

2. If changes exist:
   └─ Get file counts (untracked + modified + deleted)
   └─ Update state: filesUploading = count
   └─ Stage all: git add .
   └─ Commit: "Auto-sync: <timestamp>"

3. Get current branch (main/master)

4. Pull from remote
   └─ Fetch: refs/heads/main
   └─ Merge into local branch

5. Push to remote
   └─ Push: refs/heads/main

6. Update state:
   └─ lastSyncTime = now
   └─ filesUploading = 0
   └─ filesDownloading = 0
```

### State Management

**GitSyncState** now includes:

- `filesUploading: int` - Number of files being pushed
- `filesDownloading: int` - Number of files being pulled (future: implement pull tracking)
- `isSyncing: bool` - Prevents concurrent syncs
- `lastSyncTime: DateTime?` - Shows "synced 2m ago"
- `lastError: String?` - Shows error details

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **Download tracking not implemented** - `filesDownloading` count always 0 (pull doesn't report file counts yet)
2. **Conflict resolution is basic** - "Last write wins" for different files
3. **Large audio files** - May be slow on poor connections (consider Git LFS)
4. **Branch strategy** - Only uses `main` branch (could support per-device branches)

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] SSH key support (in addition to PAT)
- [ ] Conflict resolution UI
- [ ] Selective sync (choose which folders to sync)
- [ ] Sync history viewer
- [ ] Git LFS for audio files
- [ ] Progress bars for large file uploads
- [ ] Network-aware sync (pause on cellular, resume on WiFi)

## Configuration

### GitHub App Setup (Recommended)

Parachute now uses **GitHub Apps** for repository-specific access instead of OAuth Apps or Personal Access Tokens. This provides:

- **Repository-scoped tokens**: Only access repositories you explicitly authorize
- **Better security**: Installation tokens expire after 1 hour and auto-refresh
- **Granular permissions**: Only request "Contents: Read/Write" permission
- **User control**: Select specific repositories during authorization

**Setup Guide**: See [docs/guides/github-app-registration.md](../guides/github-app-registration.md) for complete instructions.

**Quick Setup**:

1. Register a GitHub App at https://github.com/settings/apps/new
2. Set **Callback URL** to: `open-parachute://auth/github/callback`
3. Set **Repository Permissions** → **Contents**: `Read and write`
4. Copy Client ID and Client Secret to `app/.env` file
5. Install the app and select your vault repository
6. Connect in Parachute Settings → Git Sync → "Connect with GitHub"

### Legacy: Personal Access Token (Still Supported)

If you prefer using Personal Access Tokens:

Required scopes for PAT:

- ✅ `repo` (full control of private repositories)

Create token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens

**Note**: PAT approach grants access to ALL repositories, which is less secure than GitHub Apps.

### Recommended Repository Setup

1. Create a new **private** repository on GitHub
2. Name it something like `parachute-vault`
3. Do NOT initialize with README (empty repo)
4. Copy the HTTPS URL: `https://github.com/username/parachute-vault.git`
5. Use this URL in Parachute settings (or select it in the GitHub App wizard)

## Debugging

### Logs to Watch

All Git sync operations log with `[GitSync]` prefix:

```dart
debugPrint('[GitSync] Changes detected (3 files), committing...');
debugPrint('[GitSync] ✅ Changes committed: abc123');
debugPrint('[GitSync] Pushing to origin/main');
debugPrint('[GitSync] ✅ Push successful');
```

### Common Issues

**"Push failed"**

- Check GitHub PAT is valid and has `repo` scope
- Verify repository URL is correct
- Check network connection

**"No changes to commit"**

- Files already synced
- Check if files are actually in `~/Parachute/captures/`

**"Periodic sync not running"**

- Verify Git sync is enabled in settings
- Check that setup completed successfully

---

## Performance Notes

- **Auto-sync after recording**: Adds ~1-3 seconds (runs in background)
- **Periodic sync**: Negligible impact (runs every 5 minutes)
- **Manual sync**: Depends on number of files and network speed
- **Memory**: Minimal overhead (~1-2MB for git2dart)

---

## Success Metrics

✅ **Implemented Features**:

1. Sync now commits and pushes new files
2. Auto-sync after recording saves
3. Periodic background sync (5 minute interval)
4. UI indicator with file counts
5. Tap-to-sync functionality
6. Error states and feedback

✅ **Code Quality**:

- All files analyze with no errors
- Only minor warnings (unused fields)
- Clean architecture (services, providers, UI separated)
- Non-blocking operations (Future.microtask)
